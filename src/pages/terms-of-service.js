        </p>
        <b>Modify or copy the materials;</b>
        <p>

          possession whether in electronic or printed format.
        </p>
        <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
          The materials on TikNotes.app are provided on an &apos;as is&apos;
          basis. TikNotes.app makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and
          hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without
          limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability,
          fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual
          property or other violation of rights.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, TikNotes.app does not warrant or make any representations
          concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of
          the materials on its website or otherwise relating to such materials
          or on any sites linked to this site.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, TikNotes.app is solely a tool to assist in downloading
          images from TikTok Notes. We bear no legal responsibility related to
          the reuse of these images or any potential emotional distress that may
          arise from their use. Users are solely responsible for how they use
          the downloaded images and any consequences that may result from such
          use.
        </p>
        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>
          In no event shall TikNotes.app or its suppliers be liable for any
          damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or
          profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or
          inability to use the materials on TikNotes.app, even if TikNotes.app
          or a TikNotes.app authorized representative has been notified orally
          or in writing of the possibility of such damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied
          warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or
          incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.
        </p>
        <h2>Accuracy of Materials</h2>
